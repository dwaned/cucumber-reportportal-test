    As a user
    I want to run an example test
    So that I can see if ReportPortal integration is working correctly

  @Test
  Scenario: Example scenario 1
    Given I say hello
    When I send a GET request to "https://reportportal.io"

  Scenario: Example scenario 2
    Given I say hello
    When I send a GET request to "https://reportportal.io"
